## Introduction

This GUI Network Sniffing Tool is a user-friendly application designed to provide a comprehensive set of tools for network packet sniffing. With a graphical user interface built using GTK version 3, this application simplifies the process of capturing and analyzing network traffic.

The tool leverages the popular `pcap` library for packet capturing, allowing users to sniff UDP and various other network protocols with ease. Whether you are a network administrator, security analyst, or a curious enthusiast, this application offers a simple yet powerful way to explore network packets.

## Features

- **Protocol Support**: Sniff various network protocols, including UDP, TCP, ICMP, and more.

- **Custom Filters**: Create custom filters to capture specific types of traffic, making it easy to focus on what matters most.

- **Real-Time Packet Analysis**: View captured packets in real-time, allowing for instant analysis and troubleshooting.

- **Packet Details**: Get detailed information about each captured packet, including source and destination IP addresses, ports, payload data, and more.

- **Save and Export**: Save captured packets for later analysis or export them to popular formats for further examination.
